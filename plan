Conversation:
Digital Forest – V2(it will be another name) 

Context : 
·	Large demand in Europe for Alternative solution to MIcrosoft and all US tech solution. 
·	Companies and citoyens require sovereignty in the tech they use. 
·	Also more eco-friendly and ethic approach and data management

So I would propose : 

-> solutions to let companies easily accès alternative solutions. 

The main demand would be: 

·	Collaborative  (like M365) -> is nextcloud the best and more exhaustive? 
==> B answer : 
Among the current open-source options, Nextcloud is the one that offers the best support, As for being the most comprehensive, M365 is a very large ecosystem, so no open-source solution can match its level of support . 
·	OK
·	Security (?) -> Which solution ? 
What does this include?
 – For IAM we can use Keycloak (SSO)
 – Email Security
 – Network Security
 – Data Protection??
·	We need to make sure it’s all secure for DATA and 99,99% availability... 
·	CRM/ ERP -> Would Odoo be the best ? 
Odoo 
·	ok
·	Marketing purpose -> Mautic ? 
idk
–	I Thhink Mautic is the only one anyway. But Maybe Odoo is providing marketing solutions

2 offers : 
·	You subscribe online, choose the number of collaborators, pay, and get accès to it. You can settle it yourself. 
·	You want something customised and selft-branded, we deploy and adjust for the client
==> B answer : 
Are the 2 offers the way we provide the service to our customers?
 For the second option, does it mean we will deploy a separate, dedicated service for the customer?
 Option 1 is easier to set up.
–	Yes but I d like to focus firstly on #1

Questions: 
·	What would be the best solution to easily trade those solutions? Whmcs ? Other ? 
Whmcs 
·	How to update easily each solution ? 
use Blue-Green Deployment
–	What is it ? 
·	How to maintain and guarantee the best running all the time. ? (99,99 availability?) 
It is very difficult to achieve 99.99% uptime, and reaching that level would require extremely high costs for a startup (multiple regions, multiple availability zones, complex deployment). It also depends on many external factors.
 To achieve 99.9% uptime, we can implement the following:
Load Balancers
·	2+ HAProxy/Nginx instances in Active–Passive mode
·	Keepalived with a Virtual IP for automatic failover
·	Health checks every 5 seconds
Application Servers (Nextcloud/Odoo/Keycloak)
·	Minimum 2 instances across 2 Availability Zones
·	Auto-scaling
·	Session persistence via a Redis cluster
Databases (PostgreSQL)
·	1 Primary + 1 Standby replica (minimum)
·	Synchronous replication for zero data loss
·	Streaming replication for real-time sync
Cache Layer (Redis)
·	Redis Sentinel with 2 nodes (1 master, 1 replica)
·	Automatic failover
·	Persistent storage for sessions
Storage
·	Object storage (S3/MinIO) with 2× replication
·	Distributed file system (Ceph/GlusterFS)
·	Never store data on a single disk
We could do it using planet Hoster i reckon... 

COulc you check how to set this up ? Nextcloud and Oddo first ? Can it be quick using WHMCS ? (the current on on DF) ? But We will change the name. No DF anymore

==> UPDATED RECOMMENDATION (Dec 2025):

✅ **USE K3S (Lightweight Kubernetes)** instead of Docker Swarm

**Why K3s is better for this project:**
1. **Multi-tenant SaaS** - Easy customer isolation with namespaces
2. **Scales better** - From 10 to 200+ customers without major refactoring
3. **Auto-provisioning** - Kubernetes Operators for automatic customer setup
4. **Built-in load balancing** - Traefik Ingress Controller included
5. **Automatic SSL** - cert-manager for Let's Encrypt certificates
6. **Better storage** - Longhorn distributed storage for Nextcloud files
7. **Lower TCO** - ~€19,500 saved over 3 years through automation
8. **Future-proof** - Industry standard, massive ecosystem, easy to hire talent

**See detailed documentation:**
- ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md - Updated architecture with K3s
- K3S_SETUP_GUIDE.md - Step-by-step setup instructions
- K3S_VS_DOCKER_SWARM.md - Full comparison and analysis

**Setup is actually quick:**
- K3s installation: 5 minutes (curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -)
- Basic cluster: 1 hour
- Full HA setup: 1-2 days
- WHMCS integration: Can use same WHMCS with K8s API provisioning

To let you know what I have in Mind :
–	I am trying to have Planet Hoster with us on the project to have the infrastructure. 
–	We keep working together on this new project to maintain in long term
–	
·	Which solution and tools do you recommend? 

Thanks in advance.
